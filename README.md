## Overview
sandro is an unconventional vocabulary builder application that lays a strong emphasis on usage examples to enhance understanding and retention of new terms. 

## Features
### Collections
Users can create and manage a collection of terms with their definitions as well as usage examples.

### Flashcards
The Flashcards feature enables users to review the terms intuitively by presenting a term and prompting them to recall its definition. Additionally, users can configure the feature to display the definition or the example sentence on the front of the card instead.

### Game
The game feature allows users to reinforce their vocabulary learning interactively by recalling the terms within their original context. Users are presented with an example sentence in which the term has been replaced by a blank, and they must fill in the blank with the correct term.
